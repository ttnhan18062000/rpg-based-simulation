# Handover — asset-planner

> Snapshot of the gitignored `.claude/handover/asset-planner.md` on 2026-10-06 at 2c793286f (the batch's code commit; the closing docs commit follows it); on a new machine copy it to `.claude/handover/asset-planner.md`.
Updated: 2026-10-06 (terrain set review batch built; final review and PR next)

## Open
- Batch `visual-asset-terrain-set-review` (epic TCK-20261005-EPIC-VISUAL-ASSET-TERRAIN-SET-REVIEW), branch of the same name
  in rpg-aseprite-mcp, NOT pushed. All children built; asset-implementer closes the folder, then asks me for the final review.
  Then: merge origin/main (code-health gates are blocking since 2026-10-05; batch has no src/), pr_render, and push/PR/--admin
  merge only on the user's own answers to blocking questions.
- Open question for the final review: the implementer reported W05 "gate stays INCONCLUSIVE" next to AM5-S PASS and forest
  rule PASS; confirm in the results doc why (it must be a stated reason, never a reworded gate).
- ASSET WORK PAUSED again after this batch (user 2026-10-04 pause, lifted for this batch only). Parked, no tickets: icons and
  other kinds (entities, buildings, items, UI; reuse draft sets + adopt-set), charter signing, AM-M6.
- Ignore (user, 2026-10-04): the agent-monitoring retro hook and the TCK-20260918-EPIC-PROGRESSION-STARVATION-CHAIN staleness nag.
- FYI codebase-planner (2026-10-05): advisory import contracts c14/c15 (visual_assets <-> src, no imports either way) in
  codebase/structure/importlinter.toml, may turn blocking after a 2-week soak; exceptions are our call (ask for ignore_imports).
  Code-health gates BLOCKING on main since 2026-10-05 14:47Z: `Code health` + `Type check` on src/ only. If a batch ever edits
  src/, run `make code-health` + `make typecheck-py` first.

## What this batch did (user decisions by blocking question, 2026-10-05/06)
- Set colour-vision rule `AM5-S` (all 253 pairs x 4 visions; S1 `dE_tile >= dE_fill - 2.0` or `>= 10`; S2 texture >= 2.0),
  committed before any art. Baseline terrain-v1 FAIL (30/1012) from mean-to-fill drift; no subset redraw passes, so (planner
  decision) all 22 drafts re-tinted onto their fills: PASS "by construction" = "no worse than the hue-only flat fills";
  closest pair-vision 0.857 dE (jungle/lava protan; fills 0.784).
- Borders: user found hard terrain edges weird; chose Wesnoth-style layered fringes. Contract v1 (ADR D19): 15 ranked terrains
  (water lowest ... forest highest), 8 crisp built terrains (no fringe either way), 4 px cap, C6 added to W03-SET; one shared
  mask family `border.edge|outer_corner|inner_corner` x v1-v3, client compositor `terrainBorders.ts` + `borderRender.ts`.
- User adopted terrain-v1 (22 tiles + 9 masks) by adopt-set: sa-f4c541f25f112221, 2026-10-05T18:17:03Z; guards re-pinned by
  equality (tests/visual_assets/adopted_facts.py). Releases: rc-0004 (registry hash move, forest only), rc-0005 (34 entries,
  user-approved); fixture `__fixtures__/terrainset/` (pilot fixture untouched).
- M5 rerun on rc-0005: W03-SET PASS (user: yes for all 23 on C1-C6, one reviewer); W07 PASS (4 clients); fallback and rollback
  drill recorded; overall M5 still INCONCLUSIVE (no M1/M2/M4 PASS record). Known fragility, not fixed:
  `pilot_colour_vision.tile_pixels()` takes the first PNG of the pilot export.

## State worth knowing
- Merged epics: foundation (#286, #299), hardening + M5 rehearsal (#309), pilot readiness (#317), detail variants + draft
  sets (#327), AM-M1 docs (#330), AM-M1 unblock (#334), handoff snapshots (#337).
- AM-M0 INCONCLUSIVE (user kept it), AM-M1 BLOCKED only on M0 (register 55 MET / 7 GAP / 6 N/A; owner decisions ADR D13-D18),
  AM-M2 BLOCKED, AM-M6 NO-GO, charter unsigned. Gates are never reworded to pass.
- Approved docs: `fallback_safety.md` (W06; borders are decorative), `m2_evidence_charter.md` (W11 rerun rule).
- Decided: Profile A (D8), no signing (D9), Aseprite local only (batch mode, no app window needed), detail axis (D11), draft
  sets (D12), borders (D19); retention 30 days; rollback/recall owner "nhan (owner)".
